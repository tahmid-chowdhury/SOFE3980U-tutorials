  - Book Chapter 5: Run the ***Wordz Application*** code from the available [Chapter 05 GitHub Links](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Test-Driven-Development-with-Java/tree/main/chapter05) + Take the screenshots of your running program
- Put all the screenshots in a .doc file (step-by-step providing details of each) and convert it to .pdf.
